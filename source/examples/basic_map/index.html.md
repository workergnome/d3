D3 includes a sophisticated way to display geographical data as vector files, using either the geoJSON or topoJSON formats.  

For an easy, interactive way to convert GeoJSON files into topoJSON, check out [distillery](http://shancarter.github.io/distillery/).

This example is based on the [Let's Make a Map](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) article, which goes into a good bit more detail on how to use D3 for maps..
