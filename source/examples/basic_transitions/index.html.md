title: Basic Transitions

One of the most helpful features in D3 is the ability to easily define animated transitions for our elements when their attributes change using the [`transition()`](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#selection_transition) function.

For a transition, we can define a [`duration()`](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_duration) , which is the number of millisecond that the transition takes place over.  

We can also define an [`ease()`](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_ease), which is a function that takes a value between 0 and 1 and returns a value (typically) between 0 and 1. D3 comes with a [bunch of built in easing functions](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease), and you can roll your own if you need to.

Transitions only affect the attributes set after themâ€”in our example, we've moved the radius to before the transition so that it doesn't animate.

By default, D3 does a good job of guessing how to interpolate between the start and end values.  If you'd like to explicitly define an how to interpolate, you can use the [`attrTween()`](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition/blob/master/README.md#transition_attrTween) function.
